                            Hello, World! <br /><br />
                            My name is <span>Grant Spell</span>.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            My goal is to create visually captivating and
                            comprehensive web applications that create a
                            seemingly automagical user experience. This is
                            possible through utilizing front and back-end
                            technologies to create visual and funtional components.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I approach each project with
                            in depth planning utilizing planning tools such as wireframes,
                            entity relationship diagrams [ERD], user stories, data modeling,
                            and lots of white-boarding to get down visual concepts. I am still
                            learning, but actively implementing, Agile Development
                            methodologies. I have primarily worked with Node.js and Ruby on Rails,
                            taking advantage of the React front-end JavaScript library. I have enjoyed
                            working with PostgreSQL databases most, because they make relational
                            data so much easier to work with, but I have also worked with Mongoose.

                            <br />
                            I wanted to get into web development because I have always
                            been inspired by technology and how it works. This, my
                            love for graphic design, and wanting to start a career
                            lead me to search for web development bootcamps. I enrolled
                            in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course and
                            within the first week I realized that web development
                            would allow me to balance creativity and analysis and
                            form a career around both aspects. I recently graduated from
                            General Assembly and I am currently available for hire!
